  abstract = {The rapid decrease in the size of mobile devices, coupled with an
	increase in capability, has enabled a swift proliferation of small
	and very capable devices into our daily lives. With such a prevalence
	of pervasive computing, the interaction among portable devices needs
	to be continuous and invisible to device users. As these devices
	become better connected, collaboration among them will play a vital
	role in sharing resources in an ad-hoc manner. The sharing of resources
	works as a facilitator for pervasive devices. However, this ad hoc
	interaction among devices provides the potential for security breaches.
	Trust can fight against such security violations by restricting malicious
	nodes from participating in interactions. Therefore, we need a unified
	trust relationship model between entities, which captures both the
	needs of the traditional computing world and the world of pervasive
	computing where the continuum of trust is based on identity, physical
	context or a combination of both. Here, we present a context specific
	and reputation-based trust model along with a brief survey of trust
	models suitable for peer-to-peer and ad-hoc environments. This paper
	presents a multi-hop recommendation protocol and a flexible behavioral
	model to handle interactions. One other contribution of this paper
	is the integration of an initial trust model; this model categorizes
	services or contexts in different security levels based on their
	security needs, and these security needs are considered in trust
	bootstrapping. The other major contribution of this paper is a simple
	method of handling malicious recommendations. This paper also illustrates
	the implementation and evaluation of our proposed formal trust model.},

	is only as secure as its weakest link. There are several layers of
	security and different measures that can currently be implemented.
	However, they lack coordination, and therefore potential security
	breaches might compromise the network. With wireless access becoming
	the norm, and users requiring “on the move communication” even within
	a campus, networks are expanding past the traditional wired networks
	by adding wireless access points. This gives customers the flexibility
	they require but leaves a net threat vector to the network. There
	have been various encryption and security steps taken to validate
	the communication and authentication of the devices and end users
	connecting. This project addresses the critical problem of secure
	authentication using the 802.1x standard, which will be implemented
	using Microsoft's Radius server elements. It will involve the enrollment
	of secure certificates on Windows mobile devices, thus securing mobile
	devices from physical attacks. To ensure that all steps are adhered
	to, that all necessary applications have been installed, and to handle
	Web service communication, an application will be created that will

	the nature of the relationship from a fundamental engineering perspective,
	and systematically explores where and how future advances in networked
	systems might influence the evolution of cyber-attacks, even inadvertently
	giving rise to new forms of cybercrimes. Historical data reveals
	that technological advances in engineering systems design, including
	communications and transportation, were often accompanied by lack
	of foresight, thereby inadvertently opening doors to new forms of
	vulnerabilities following deployment. The greater the extent of the
	advancement, the deeper the potential chasm and more severe the damage
	incurred when a clever perpetrator successfully exploits the weaknesses.
	For example, when the Bell Telephone System employed human operators
	to switch telephone calls in the early 1900s, anonymous and unauthorized
	long-distance calls were a rarity. As soon as automatic switching
	equipment replaced human operators, “phone phreaks”1 discovered a
	serious flaw in the system. First by simply whistling or using a
	toy whistle and later through utilizing a tone-generating bluebox,
	one could break into the signaling control and make unauthorized
	long-distance calls. },

	computing resources as on-demand services over the Internet. Like
	all forms of outsourcing, cloud computing raises serious concerns
	about the security of the data assets that are outsourced to providers

	today's generation of information security management systems (ISMSs),
	as specified in the ISO/IEC 27001:2005, must be extended to address
	the transfer of security controls into cloud environments. The resulting
	virtual ISMS is a standards-compliant management approach for developing
	a sound control environment while supporting the various modalities
	of cloud computing. This article addresses chief security and/or
	information officers of cloud client and cloud provider organizations.
	Cloud clients will benefit from our exposition of how to manage risk
	when corporate assets are outsourced to cloud providers. Providers
	of cloud services will learn what processes and controls they can
	offer in order to provide superior security that differentiates their
	offerings in the market. },

	there are significant issues that need to be addressed in order for
	cloud computing to be adopted as universally as the Internet. Among

	The goal of cloud computing is to share data and services transparently
	among users of a massive grid referred to generically as “the cloud.”
	The promise of the cloud is in achieving significant cost savings
	and information technology agility. This paper examines some of the
	more important key drivers and constraints for secure cloud computing
	from a societal and technological perspective. The societal issues
	addressed involved trust, privacy, and user behavior and how security
	affects these factors. The technological issues include scalability,
	reliability, encryption, data rights, and transparency. Transparency
	is a constraint for cloud computing today, and a case can be made

  abstract = {Mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a self-configuring network that is
	formed automatically via wireless links by a collection of mobile
	nodes without the help of a fixed infrastructure or centralized management.
	The mobile nodes forward packets for each other, allowing communication
	among nodes outside wireless transmission range hop by hop. Due to
	dynamic infrastructure-less nature and lack of centralized monitoring
	points, the ad hoc networks are vulnerable to attacks. Attacks on
	ad hoc network routing protocols disrupt network performance and
	reliability. This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive overview
	of attacks and secure routing. It first analyzes the reason that
	ad hoc network is vulnerable to attacks. Then it presents the well
	known attacks and the popular secure protocols.},

  abstract = {Electronic discovery refers to a process in which electronic data
	is sought, located, secured, and searched with the intent of using
	it as evidence in a legal case. Computer forensics is the application
	of computer investigation and analysis techniques to perform an investigation
	to find out exactly what happened on a computer and who was responsible.
	IDC estimates that the U.S. market for computer forensics will be
	grow from \$252 million in 2004 to \$630 million by 2009. Business
	is strong outside the United States, as well. By 2011, the estimated
	international market will be \$1.8 billion dollars. The Techno Forensics
	Conference has increased in size by almost 50\% in its second year;
	another example of the rapid growth in the market. 
	
	
	This book is the first to combine cybercrime and digital forensic
	topics to provides law enforcement and IT security professionals
	with the information needed to manage a digital investigation. Everything
	needed for analyzing forensic data and recovering digital evidence
	can be found in one place, including instructions for building a
	digital forensics lab.
	
	
	* Digital investigation and forensics is a growing industry

	issues and problems that we face in centralised approaches as well

	in the HealthAgents project wherein a prototype system was developed
	and a novel approach employed that supports data transfer and decision
	making in human brain tumour diagnosis and treatment. While the decision
	making needs to rely on different clinical expertise, the HealthAgents
	system leveraged a domain ontology to align different sub-domain
	vocabularies and we have experimented with a process calculus to
	glue together distributed services. We examine the capability of
	the Lightweight Coordination Calculus (LCC), a process calculus based
	language, in meeting security challenges in pervasive settings, especially
	in the healthcare domain. The key difference in approach lies in
	making the representational abstraction reflect the relative autonomy
	of the various clinical specialisms involved in contributing to patient
	management. The scope within LCC of accommodating Boolean-valued
	constraints allows for flexible integration of heterogeneous sources
	in multiple formats, which are characteristic features of a pervasive
	healthcare environment.},

	Many solutions have been proposed in the past to detect insider threats.
	Unfortunately, given the complexity of the problem and the human
	factors involved, many solutions which have been proposed face strict
	constraints and limitations when it comes to the working environment.
	As a result, many past insider threat solutions have in practice
	failed in their implementations. In this work, we review some of
	the recent insider threat detection solutions and explore their benefits
	and limitations. We also discuss insider threat issues for emerging
	areas such as cloud computing, virtualization, and social networking.
